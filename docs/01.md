* Why do we need cryptography?
  * Cryptography (Secret writing)
  * Mathematical methods to ensure data Integrity

* Basic Terminology
* Cryptology: Cryptography and Cryptanalysis
* Symmetric/Asymmetris, Hash, Protocols
* Block vs Stream
* Digital Signature
* Computer vs Network vs Internet Security
* Security Attack: Passive, Active: Replay, Message Modification, Denial of Service
* Security Service: signatures, protection from disclosure, tampering, destruction
* X.800: Authentication, Access Control, Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, Non-repudiation
* Security Mechanism: Designed to detect, prevent, or recover from a security attack
* Specific Security Mechanisms: encipherment (encryption), digital signatures, access control, data
integrity, authentication, traffic padding, routing control, notarization
* Pervasive Security Mechanisms: trusted functionality, security labels, event detection, security
audit trails, security recovery
* Steganography
* Skytale
* Kerckhoffâ€™s principle
* Uncoditional security vs Computational security
* Substitution ciphers
* Shift ciphers: Caesar, ROT13, etc.
* Vigenere cipher
* Permutation Ciphers
* Enigma
* Vernam cipher (one time pad): Advantages and disadvantages
