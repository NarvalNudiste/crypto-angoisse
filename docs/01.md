### 01 Introduction

* Why do we need cryptography?
  * *To keep stuff safe*
  * *To break safe stuff*


* Basic Terminology
  * Computer security : *Generic name for the tools designed to protect data*
  * Network security : *Protect data during transmission*
  * Internet security : *Protect data during transmission over networks*
  * Cypher : *Encrypted message*


* Cryptology: Cryptography and Cryptanalysis
    * Cryptology : *science of the secret*
    * Cryptography :   *Cryptography (Secret writing),
      mathematical methods to ensure data Integrity*
    * Cryptanalysis : *Discipline of decryption of information without
    knowing the method of encryption/decryption*


* Symmetric/Asymmetric, Hash, Protocols
  * Symmetric : *Block sypher, stream cypher*
    * *Sender and recipient share the same key*
    * *All classical encryption algorithms are private key*
    * *Only type before public key in 1970*
  * Asymmetric : *Key exchange, Confidentiality, digital signature*
  * Hash : *String of hexadecimals chars obtained after an encryption with an hash function*
  * Protocols : *Abstract or concrete protocole that describes how algorithms should be used to apply cryptographic methods*

* Block vs Stream
  * Stream cypher :
    * *Infinite cryptographic keystream, encrypting one bit/byte at a time*
    * *Usually faster and uses less memory*
    * *More difficult to implement*
    * *No integrity protection*
  * Block cypher :
    * *Work on large chunks of data*
    * *Can be combined for additional security*
    * *Uses more memory*

* Digital Signature
  * *Mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of a message*

* Computer vs Network vs Internet Security
  * *Voir Basic terminology*

* Security Attack: Passive, Active: Replay, Message Modification, Denial of Service
* Security Service: signatures, protection from disclosure, tampering, destruction
* X.800: Authentication, Access Control, Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, Non-repudiation
* Security Mechanism: Designed to detect, prevent, or recover from a security attack
* Specific Security Mechanisms: encipherment (encryption), digital signatures, access control, data
integrity, authentication, traffic padding, routing control, notarization
* Pervasive Security Mechanisms: trusted functionality, security labels, event detection, security
audit trails, security recovery
* Steganography
* Skytale
  * *Oldest military cryptographyc tool known*
  * *We roll a skin around a stick of a certain diameter in order to be able to read it*
  * *The exact diameter has to be used*


* Kerckhoffâ€™s principle
* Uncoditional security vs Computational security
* Substitution ciphers
* Shift ciphers: Caesar, ROT13, etc.
* Vigenere cipher
* Permutation Ciphers
* Enigma
* Vernam cipher (one time pad): Advantages and disadvantages
